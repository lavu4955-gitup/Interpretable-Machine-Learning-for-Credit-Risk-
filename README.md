This project focuses on predicting loan default risk using machine learning.
The goal is not only to build an accurate model but also to ensure the predictions are interpretable.
A financial dataset is preprocessed through cleaning, encoding, and scaling steps.
A high-performance classifier such as XGBoost is trained and optimized using AUC and F1 metrics.
SHAP is applied to provide global explanations showing which features influence predictions overall.
LIME is used to generate local explanations for individual borrower decisions.
Three loan cases—clear approval, clear denial, and borderline—are analyzed in detail.
Both SHAP and LIME explanations are compared to understand agreement and differences.
Insights are translated into simple business language suitable for loan officers.
The final output includes complete code, visual explanations, and written interpretation.
